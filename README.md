CS3 Group Project By Cole O'Balle, Nathan Rancourt, and Gage Fend

Your Goal is to build a factory to create 25 of every item in the game, totaling to 1,350 items
in order to create the Spirit of the Wilderness. It is this spirit that Mr Yee needs in order to
cure the curse of League of Legends from his students, who have hijacked his classroom. The
Spirit of the Wilderness works as a great enlightener and reminder of the wonders of the
outdoors.

Please ignore the Menu button in the Pause menu
Its a useless button that does nothing that I forgot to remove when building the project.
And I DO NOT WANT TO BUILD THIS 350+ MB BEHEAMOTH AGAIN
